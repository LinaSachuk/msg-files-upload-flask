Description 

- Create a simple UI that allows the end user to upload a message file. Once the file is uploaded, email message level data should be displayed in the UI.
- Sample message files can be found in the "smallset" directory.  
- The only hard requirements are listed below â€“ we have left a lot of room for you to make implementation decisions on your own. 
- Add any documentation that you think is necessary for someone to successfully review and run your code.  
- Share completed exercise via Github/Gitlab link, zip file etc.
- A senior engineer will review and run your code. 
- If your sample passes the code review, we will schedule a follow up technical interview with our team where we will ask you to make changes and run your code in a live session over Zoom. 

Requirements 

Using your choice of programming languages listed below, implement an API driven web application. 
1) API: Using Go, Python, or PHP, implement an API that can parse an email message supplied by the UI. The API should return the following email headers:
